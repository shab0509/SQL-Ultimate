1. Types of Window Functions

    Ranking Functions
        ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns a unique number to each row.
        RANK(): Assigns ranks with gaps for ties.
        DENSE_RANK(): Assigns ranks without gaps.
        NTILE(n): Divides rows into n buckets.
        PERCENT_RANK() : The PERCENT_RANK() window function calculates the relative rank of a row as a percentage
                         between 0 and 1 within its result set or partition

        DENSE_RANK() vs RANK() WINDOW FUNCTION:
        RANK() window function assigns a rank to each row in the ordered result set. If two or more
        rows have the same value in the ORDER BY clause, they receive the same rank. However, RANK()
        skips ranks after ties, leaving gaps in the rank sequence.
        Like RANK(), it assigns a rank to rows based on the specified ORDER BY clause. However,
        DENSE_RANK() does not skip ranks. When two or more rows tie, they get the same rank, but the
        next row gets the immediate subsequent rank.

    Aggregate Functions with OVER()
        SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT(): Used to compute running totals, moving averages, etc.

    Value Functions
        LEAD(): Accesses data from the next row.
        LAG(): Accesses data from the previous row.
        FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE(): Gets the first or last value in a window.

2. OVER Clause Components

    PARTITION BY: Divides the result set into partitions.
    ORDER BY: Orders rows within each partition.
    ROWS or RANGE: Defines the frame of rows for calculation.

3. Named Windows

    Reuse window definitions across multiple functions using the WINDOW clause.

4. Frame Specifications

    Define how many rows before or after the current row to include:

        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING

5. Use Cases

    Running totals
    Moving averages
    Percentile calculations
    Comparing current row with previous/next
    Complex reporting and analytics
